## About:
This is a simple boilerplate for a HTML webpage. It comes with some built in features to help with developing your page.

### Using:
Go to the directory you want your project in and run ```git clone https://github.com/ParkerShelton/HTML-Boilerplate.git projectName```. Replace projectName with the name of your project.

Then all you have to do is run ```npm i``` inside your new project directory and get to work! To get the sass compiler to recognize the .scss files, you'll have to open them up and save them once. After that you should be good to go!

```npm start``` will run the live server with the index.html and start watching your sass files.
