# Cards Collection Remake

## About the project:
### I wanted to keep practicing the front-end skills I already know and experimenting with different things I'm not familiar with. I downloaded a sketch file designed by Abhishek Biswas from www.sketchappsources.com. My goal was to take the design and turn it into a responsive webpage that you can have some interactions with(buttons press down, links change the mouse cursor etc..).

### If you want to download it to see how it works, all you have to do is either download the zip or clone the repository. Once you're inside the projects root folder run ```npm install```. After it's done installing, start it up by running ```npm start```. It should have a live browser so you don't have to refresh and also automatically watches for sass files. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions!
